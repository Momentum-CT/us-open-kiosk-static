# Web Hosted POAP Kiosk

This is the content that is actually getting served by the Electron app.
The kiosk links will need to be updated for week 2.

## How It Works

This content is being shown in kiosk mode by the electron app [here](https://github.com/Momentum-CT/AMEX-USOPEN-poap-kiosk-).

Any content updates should be made to this repo.

### Why are there three kiosk pages?

There are three kiosk pages, one for each screen. They each have about 20k links assigned to them.

### What about the second week?

Sam Coffey should sent the kiosk links for week two near the end of the first week.
